lessons learned

Initially we had decided to code our server in java.  Because all of our group members are skilled with coding in java and all of the java libraries that would be at our disposal, it sounded like a good idea.  We then designed our java server and began to code it.  After getting into the code, our java was very difficult to implement.  While it would have been possible to continue coding our server in java, it was becoming a arduous task.  Java didn’t have features that would make coding the server much easier (such as HTTP handling and multithreading capabilities) built into the language like other languages available do. We decided that the costs of learning a new language and refactoring the server was worth the time and effort.  Based on our needs, we decided to go with Google’s GoLang.
