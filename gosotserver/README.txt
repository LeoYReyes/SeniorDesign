Server Setup Instructions:

	NOTE: The server executable can be in any directory, but the directories
	      in step 2 must also be in the same directory as the executable.

	1. Make sure that the database is running before running the server
	2. Copy the following directories to the same directory that the
	   server executable is located.
		* /css
		* /images
		* /js
		* /templates
	3. Run the SMS gateway application and connect to the server's IP 
	   address using port 10016.
	4. Once the database and the SMS gateway are running, you can now execute
	   the server executable.

Accessing Website:

	Once the server is running, the website can be accessed through any
	browser with the URL: 
		
		hostname:8080

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs/issues:

	* Device registration request:
		- The server is currently checking the device ID using only length
		  to determine what type of device the request was sent as. Anything 
		  less than 12 characters is recognized as a GPS device and anything
		  greater is a laptop device. Any IDs that arenâ€™t of length 10(GPS)
		  or 12(laptop) could cause a problem.
